# Path to directory, containing mpv.exe
# Should be absolute path, but place holders can be used
# to denote certain directories
# %h - at the beginning means home directory
# %r - at the beginning means runmpv executable directory
# %v - at the beginning means directory, where video is located
#
# Also, path should end with /. That is important, because
# runmpv concatenates this path and mpv to form full path to
# mpv executable.
#
# Default value under Linux is an empty string "",
# so that runmpv would launch just mpv without prefix.
#
# Default value under Windows is %r/../, because I
# suppose it's convenient ot put directory, which
# contains runmpv to mpv directory.
# mpvHomeDir=%r/../
# Describes when runmpv opens a new mpv instance.
# If openMode is anything but instance-per-directory,
# runmpv opens single instance of mpv and always uses it to open videos.
# If openMode is instance-per-directory, then runmpv opens new mpv
# instance to play videos from every directory. And uses existing mpv instance
# to play new files from the same directory.
# Default value is single-instance
openMode=single-instance
# Name of the pipe for JSON IPC.
# Used to identify single mpv instance.
# Pipe is going to be created by mpv.exe
pipeName=runmpv-mpv-pipe
# Path to mpv log file
# This is the file, where mpv.exe (the instance controlled by runmpv)
# will write it's own logs.
# If property is not found, then mpv logging is controlled by
# mpv settings entirely
# Should be absolute path, but place holders can be used
# to denote certain directories
# %h - at the beginning means home directory
# %r - at the beginning means runmpv executable directory
# %v - at the beginning means directory, where video is located
# mpvLogFile=%r/runmpv-mpv.log
# Path to emergency logging system, used to diagnose
# why regular logging doesn't work.
# If property is not found, emergency logging system is disabled.
# Should be absolute path, but place holders can be used
# to denote certain directories
# %h - at the beginning means home directory
# %r - at the beginning means runmpv executable directory
# %v - at the beginning means directory, where video is located
# runnerLogFile=%r/runmpv.log
# Amount of time after which runmpv decides, that it couldn't launch mpv
# and it's time to quit. Measured in seconds.
# Needed, because if you launch video files from hard drive,
# a lot of time may pass until the HDD spins up
waitSeconds=5
# If true, mpv window is focused after new

# is only focused on first launch.
# Anything but true or false will result

# Only works under windows
# Default value is true
