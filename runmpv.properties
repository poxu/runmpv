# Describes when runmpv opens a new mpv instance.
# If openMode is anything but instance-per-directory,
# runmpv opens single instance of mpv and always uses it to open videos.
# If openMode is instance-per-directory, then runmpv opens new mpv
# instance to play videos from every directory. And uses existing mpv instance
# to play new files from the same directory.
# Default value is single-instance

# Used to identify single mpv instance.
# Pipe is going to be created by mpv.exe

# Path to mpv log file
# This is the file, where mpv.exe (the instance controlled by runmpv)
# will write it's own logs.
# If property is not found, then mpv logging is controlled by
# mpv settings entirely
